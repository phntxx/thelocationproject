## About

theLocationProject is a little (L)AMP-based social network that uses HTML5 to get the geolocation to provide posts with a location. The goal of this (besides just being a fun side-project) is that public events and party locations can easily be shared.

## Installation

theLocationProject has been ported to Docker, making the installation extremely simple.

1. Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

2. Clone the theLocationProject-repository and build the container
```
$ git clone https://github.com/phntxx/thelocationproject.git
$ cd thelocationproject/
$ docker-compose up
```

And you're done! Now open up a web browser and navigate to   
`http://<IP of your host machine>`
